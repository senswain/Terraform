# Terraform
Repository containing all of my Terraform learnings

Below is a description of of the Azure resources I have created in the other files in this repository. Primarily the sequential creation of resources in "main.tf".

9 Azure resources are created in the following order:

1. Resource Group
2. Virtual Network
3. Subnet
4. Network Security Group
5. Network Security Rule
6. Network Security Group Association
7. Public IP address
8. Network Interface Card
9. Virtual Machine

All of the resources interact with one another
